The provided Python code is designed for a comprehensive analysis of experimental data from a study examining the effects of various drug regimens on tumor volume in mice. Specifically, the analysis focuses on the Capomulin regimen alongside three other treatments: Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. The code first filters and processes the data to find the final tumor volume for each mouse at the last recorded timepoint. It then calculates statistical measures such as the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and the standard error of the mean for each drug regimen. The outcomes of these calculations help in assessing the effectiveness and variability of each treatment, culminating in a better understanding of their impacts on tumor growth.

Further enhancing the analysis, the code generates various plots to visually represent the data, including line plots, box plots, and scatter plots. For example, a line plot tracks the progression of tumor volume over time for individual mice treated with Capomulin, highlighting the drug's impact. Additionally, the code computes and visualizes a scatter plot of mouse weight against average tumor volume for the Capomulin-treated group, including a regression line that indicates the relationship between these variables. Correlation coefficients and linear regression analyses are also conducted to statistically quantify the strength and nature of the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume. These visualizations and statistical tools are pivotal in providing clear insights into the dataset, aiding researchers in drawing meaningful conclusions from the study.
